Postprocessor
=============

**Objective**: Develop a postprocessor module 
in the Online Lab based on the Geometry editor
and Hermes2D, to perform various postprocessing 
operations on piecewise-polynomial finite 
element solutions.

**Features requested**:

(1) Visualization of solutions along mesh 
    edges (lists of mesh edges). The user 
    will create a list containing of one 
    or more existing mesh edges and visualize 
    and save the solution as a 1D graph 
    along the line.
(2) The same, but along an arbitrary line
    in the domain that consists of one or 
    more linear or curved lines. 
(3) Computing an integral of the solution, 
    or some quantity derived from the 
    solution, along such lines.
(4) Computing an integral of the solution, 
    or some quantity derived from the 
    solution, over patches of elements 
    in the mesh.
